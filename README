Su-26 v1.0 alpha 1

Copyright 2006 Enrique Laso Leon
Final releases will be released under GPL or LGPL but for the time being I 
reserve the rights to release any modification on the model. 
This is in order to get only one thread of development.
This will NEVER be a commercial product.

This is my first attempt at a model for flightgear.
This release is meant for early debugging of the flight dynamics model and
collecting feedback on the 3D model and animations.

Feel free to post your feedback at the following address on AVSIM flightgear
